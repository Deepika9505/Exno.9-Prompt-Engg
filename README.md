## Aim

To perform the exploration of different prompting techniques for generating and manipulating video content (e.g., animations, visual effects, cinematic scenes, and video summaries) using AI models.

---

## Algorithm

1. Familiarize yourself with **AI video generation models** such as Runway Gen-2, Synthesia, Pictory, and DeepBrain.
2. Identify the capabilities and limitations of each tool.
3. Start with **simple prompts** to generate short videos with minimal detail.
4. Refine prompts by adding **specific details** such as background, lighting, actions, or expressions.
5. Include **time and motion elements** like transitions, pacing, or camera movements.
6. Experiment with **different video styles** (cinematic, animated, artistic, realistic).
7. **Iterate and refine prompts** to improve video quality, motion flow, and realism.
8. Generate **multiple versions** of the same prompt to study variation in outputs.
9. Save and **compare outputs** to analyze prompt effectiveness.

## Procedure

1. **Tool Familiarization** – Explored Runway Gen-2, Synthesia, and Pictory for text-to-video generation.
2. **Simple Prompt Test** – Example: *“A person walking in a park.”*

   * Output: A basic short clip of a person moving through a park environment.
3. **Detailed Prompt Test** – Example: *“A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky and a dog running beside them.”*

   * Output: Richer video with context, better scene detail, and improved realism.
4. **Time & Motion Prompt** – Example: *“A time-lapse of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from a beach, capturing the waves and changing sky colors.”*

   * Output: Dynamic scene with time progression and camera motion.
5. **Style Prompting** – Example: *“An animated futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd of people.”*

   * Output: Stylized, animation-like futuristic video.
6. **Iterative Refinement** – Example: *“A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on the wet street and a high-speed chase scene.”*

   * Output: More professional and cinematic results with richer effects.
7. **Multiple Variations** – Slightly rephrased prompts were tested to observe differences in motion, pacing, and visual consistency.
8. **Output Comparison** – Videos generated from each prompt type were saved and compared to highlight the effect of structured prompting.

## Observations

* Simple prompts → produce **basic, generic videos** with minimal detail.
* Detailed prompts → improve **visual richness and scene accuracy**.
* Adding time/motion elements → creates **dynamic and cinematic effects**.
* Style-based prompts → control the **look and feel** (animation vs. realistic).
* Iterative refinement → ensures **higher quality and consistency**.
* Prompt phrasing variations → significantly affect **video sequence and pacing**.
